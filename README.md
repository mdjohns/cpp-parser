# C++ Parser

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to create an online interactive C++ environment with easy error messaging. By simplifying the development environment, students will have an easier time diving in to learning programming.

This is an internship project developed for [UAPTC](https://uaptc.edu), managed by Professor Michael McMillan. Marcus Johnson, Ashley Newsom, and Jugal Patel are student contributors to this project. **This is a work in progress**.

## Technologies

This project will be a JavaScript web application designed to be run in the browser.
